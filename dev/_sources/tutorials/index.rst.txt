This collection of tutorials (under development) demonstrates the use of MetPy to perform
common meteorological tasks.

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Early in our scientific careers we all learn about the importance of paying attention to units in our calculations. Unit conversions can still get the best of us and have caused more than one major technical disaster, including the crash and complete loss of the $327 million Mars Climate Orbiter.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="When plotting your data on a map you want to be able to plot the data in a useful area and with a projection that would match the areal extent well. Within MetPy we have generated more than 400 pre-defined areas that also have associated projections, which you can use to make quick plots over regions of interest with minimal effort on your part. While these were intended to be used with the MetPy declarative syntax, these areas and projections are now accessible for any use of plotting data on a map using Cartopy.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Upper air analysis is a staple of many synoptic and mesoscale analysis problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data, plot it, perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results. To learn more about the Skew-T diagram and its use in weather analysis and forecasting, checkout this air weather service guide.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="xarray is a powerful Python package that provides N-dimensional labeled arrays and datasets following the Common Data Model. MetPy&#x27;s suite of meteorological calculations are designed to integrate with xarray DataArrays as one of its two primary data models (the other being Pint Quantities). MetPy also provides DataArray and Dataset accessors (collections of methods and properties attached to the .metpy property) for coordinate/CRS and unit operations.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The declarative syntax that is a part of the MetPy packaged is designed to aid in simple data exploration and analysis needs by simplifying the plotting context from typical verbose Python code. The complexity of data wrangling and plotting are hidden behind the simplified syntax to allow a lower barrier to investigating your data.">
